## Overview

The **Car Price Predictor** project uses machine learning models to predict the price of second-hand cars based on input features such as the make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and more. This project aims to:

- Provide insights into factors affecting car prices.
- Offer an easy-to-use interface for price prediction.
- Serve as a learning resource for machine learning enthusiasts.

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the data for analysis and modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts meaningful features for model training.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements and evaluates various regression models to find the best-performing one.
- **Prediction Interface**: Offers a simple way to input car details and receive price predictions.
- **Visualization**: Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations to understand the data better.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alfiya-Ansari/CarPricePredictor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CarPricePredictor
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Launch the application or run the Jupyter Notebook for exploration.

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset by ensuring it is in the correct format (CSV or similar). Place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the `app.py` (if available) for a web-based interface, or execute the notebook `CarPricePrediction.ipynb` for exploration.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Input car details to receive predicted prices.
4. Customize the project by experimenting with different models or data.
